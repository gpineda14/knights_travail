# Knights Travail

I created a program that finds the shortest path given two [x, y] coordinates. The created the program as part of the Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms?ref=lc-pb)

## What the program needs to do

1. Search through all possible ways to get from one square to another (check)
2. You must also have to find the shortest path(check)
  - This means I would need to look through all possible paths(check)
3. You have to make sure that the knight does not make any illegal moves(check)
